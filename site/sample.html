		s there a more down-to-earth cricketer than MS Dhoni in current times? The former India skipper has time and again shown his humane side and en route to Dubai for the Indian Premier League (IPL) camp with Chennai Super Kings (CSK), the veteran cricketer gave another example of his humility.

Dhoni, many of his CSK teammates and staff members boarded the flight to UAE as they left from Chennai for to kickstart the preparations for the 13th edition of the IPL on Friday. During the flight, Dhoni is said to have swapped his business class seat with an economy class passengers as the latter's 'legs were too long' to fit in economy class seats.

A Twitter user by the name of George uploaded a video of the flight claiming the same. The man claiming so looked like a CSK staffer himself. The tweet was even liked by the official Twitter account of the Super Kings.
